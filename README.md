🎙️ Voice-Activated Personal Assistant (Python)
This project is a Python-based voice-activated personal assistant that allows users to interact using voice commands. It listens to spoken input through a microphone, processes commands using speech recognition, and responds using text-to-speech, providing a smooth and interactive experience.

The assistant can:

Tell the current time

Fetch real-time weather information

Read the latest news headlines

Set voice-based reminders

The project integrates external APIs for weather and news data and demonstrates the practical use of speech recognition, API handling, and automation in Python. It is designed as a beginner-friendly yet functional AI assistant suitable for academic projects and learning purposes.
